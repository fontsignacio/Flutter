The basic Functions: 
- main(): your main function will likely initiate any pre-processing needed for your program, and end with a function call that runs the rest of your app. 
- runApp(): is a Flutter function that runs your Flutter app
- MaterialApp(): An application that uses Material Design.
- Scaffold(): which provides standard app elements like an AppBar and a Drawer
- AppBar():An app bar consists of a toolbar and potentially other widgets, such as a TabBar and a FlexibleSpaceBar.
- Container(): A convenience widget that combines common painting, positioning, and sizing widgets.
- Center(): A widget that centers its child within itself. 

child: is for only one son 
- child: Text('Widget Text')

children is for more than one son
- children: <Widget>[Text('Widget Text 1'), Text('Widget Text 2')]

## 2- Statelles Widget

A widget that does not require mutable state.

A stateless widget is a widget that describes part of the user interface by building a constellation of other widgets that describe the user interface more concretely. The building process continues recursively until the description of the user interface is fully concrete.
